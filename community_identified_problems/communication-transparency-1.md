## Initiatives for better transparency between EIDF devs and end-users across the university - Priority 6

It has come to my attention that:

1. Oftentimes queries may be put into a queue, without the ticket reflecting any sort of urgency indicators, or how high in the list something is.
2. The EIDF task queue is invisible to the end-users, hence they have no way of being aware of potentially something can be done better, or some key issues are on the bottom of the queue, so they can raise the subject with the relevant people.
3. The EIDF devs are continually trying to improve the cluster on things never asked for, and at times that were never discussed with the user-base, leading to the cluster being ofline before a key conference.
4. Since the EIDF task queue is invisible the user-base can easily get frustrated and feel invisible, when I am sure the EIDF folks are working hard on our queries behind the scenes.
5. The user-baseâ€™s trust to the dev folks is becoming corroded due to the lack of transparency and open dialogue with the community.

I believe that a more transparent process related to the task queue / ticket queue and what is currently in the works, what is coming up next and what the roadmap looks like would allow the community to more effectively contribute and request improvements, as well as increasing everyones trust and quality of experience with the compute cluster and the teams behind it.

There is a department full of people that are begging to be able to use the cluster more effectively, many of which are even willing to offer thorough proposals, or even help with the work. We are all very resource constrained in the university, hence, transparency, communication and better feedback mechanisms could potentially prove very rich resources for improving things, without anyone having to put in extra work than what they are already willing to put.
