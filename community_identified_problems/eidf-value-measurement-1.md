# EIDF Cluster: Value Measurement, Assessment and Improvement - Priority 1
## 1. Description of Issue

Today's research landscape demands a multifaceted appreciation of the value rendered by resources such as the EIDF cluster. The value cannot solely be scaled by traditional tangibles like computation power or storage size. It's vital to consider intangibles that could immensely contribute to the overall offerings researchers can leverage and the potential benefits and impact this resource can generate. 

There is currently a lack of a quantifiable measure that encapsulates the 'value' the EIDF cluster delivers to its diverse users, making it challenging to evaluate its effectiveness and guide future decision-making.

## 2. Analysis

The need for an evaluation approach that is more comprehensive and user-centric has been identified. This approach should take into account user-based metrics, publication outputs, grants and funding secured, key innovations enabled solely by the cluster, skill development among users, the school's enhanced reputation, and the cluster's scalability and adaptability to meet ever-evolving technological demands.

## 3. Proposed Solutions

To capture this multi-dimensional view of 'value', an initiative could be implemented in the form of a simple, yet efficient weekly survey. This survey could consist of 5 questions graded on a scale of 1 to 10. By conducting such a survey, insights into user experiences and perceptions can be captured even if users only complete the survey twice a month. 

To maximize the extracted value from these surveys, an open comment section should be included. By leveraging cutting-edge tools like GPT-4, we can automatically parse the comments into easily digestible data summarised into key concerns and proposals. These insights can then be used by the EIDF team to continue its ongoing improvement of the cluster's value to its users.
