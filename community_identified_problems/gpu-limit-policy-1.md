## Issue with GPU Allocation Policy

### Issue Description
#### Summary
Currently, despite the vast GPU resources at our disposal (including 88 A100 @ 40GB GPUs, 32 A100 @ 80GB GPUs, and several hundred MiG GPUs), the utilization of these resources is hindered by the policy limiting Informatics' access to only 60 GPUs. This ceiling on GPU access is resulting in various unforeseen outcomes: GPU resources are left idle, while queues for Informatics users are forming.

#### Detailed Description
The main idea behind this restrictive policy is presumably to prevent Informatics from seizing GPU resources that could be used by other departments. But, in reality, no department outside of Informatics is making significant use of these GPUs, or has shown capability or intention to do so. Consequently, a considerable number of GPUs (more than 60) are currently idle and merely consuming electricity, while there are more than 30 users in Informatics itself waiting for GPU access.

#### Proposed Solutions
1) **Review allocation policy**: Consider a revision of the GPU allocation policy so that idle resources can be dynamically allocated to departments based on their demand and usage.
2) **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Implement a system that detects idle GPUs and allocates them to queued tasks regardless of the department, maximizing resource utilization.
3) **Training/Educational Programs**: Offer to train personnel from other departments in GPU usage, ensuring broader and more equitable access to this crucial resource.

I do hope these suggestions provide a good starting point for addressing this issue. Our collective objective is to maximize the effective use of our valuable GPU resources.
