## Initiatives to Improve Cluster Support Response Times - Priority 4

Slow support response times are affecting the cluster's usability and our research productivity. Immediate changes are needed.

### Improving Support Response Time

#### Summary:

Long wait times for support—such as two weeks for disk expansion on the login node—are unacceptable. We need quicker response times and more community autonomy for resolving issues.

#### Proposals:

1. **Support Availability**: At least one staff member should be available on Slack to respond within 2 hours or less to any request.

2. **Privilege Elevation**: Consider granting higher privilege status to vetted community members. This allows for quicker issue resolution while maintaining security and compliance.

3. **Internal Monitoring**: EIDF should deploy scripts that monitor critical system components like the login node. Automatic alerts for full memory, CPU, or disk would enable immediate action.

These changes are crucial for the cluster's effectiveness and our collective productivity. Let's implement them as soon as possible.
