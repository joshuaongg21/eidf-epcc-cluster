## Establishing a Well-Defined Process for Data Transfer to the Cluster - Priority 5

There is currently no well-defined method for transferring data from university machines to the cluster, leading to inefficiencies and potential bottlenecks. I propose that we establish an official process to address this issue.

### Well-Defined Process for Data Transfer:

#### Nuance:
The absence of a standardized data transfer method forces users to either use the login node as an intermediary or store data on external internet services for later download to the cluster.

#### Existing Ideas:

- **External Upload and Download**: Currently, users often resort to uploading data to platforms like HuggingFace, GitHub, or Google Drive, and then downloading it onto the nodes. This is neither secure nor efficient.

- **Utilize University Network**: A more effective method would involve using the university's internal network for faster and more secure data transfers.

- **Official Process for Cloning PVCs**: Establishing an official process for cloning PVCs would streamline data management and reduce redundancy.

Implementing a standardized data transfer process will improve efficiency, security, and overall user experience.
